🔶Description🔶
-----
- I WLL UPDATE THE STUB SO THAT IT STILL FUD <strong>FOREVER</strong> and to paid my effort <strong>❗ DO NOT UPLOAD TO VIRUS TOTAL ❗</strong>
Contribute to the dream of making the only github fud crypter that will still <strong>FUD</strong>.

I created this <strong>100% FUD</strong> crypter for myself but I decided to share it.
I simplified it so that it can be accessible to everyone, so it's very easy to use and already compiled.
It was actually made for windows but I will release the source code and modify it a little bit so that linux users can use it too (I tried on wine and it's not working)

🔶Usage/Install🔶
-----

🔶How does it work🔶
----

ORIONX got a complex AES256 and XOR encryption. It crypt the bytes of your exe so that it's encrypted in memory and then decrypted in runtime.
